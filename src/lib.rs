#![deny(missing_docs)]
//! A generic eventually-correct framework over unreliable connections, such as UDP.
//!
//! This crate uses a struct called `Connector` that eventually guarantees that all persistent messages
//! arrive at the other end, or it will disconnect.
//!
//! This crate differentiates between two message types:
//! * Confirmed: This is a message that is:
//! * * Guaranteed to arrive ***at some point***
//! * * Not guaranteed to arrive in the correct order
//! * Unconfirmed: This is a message that is not guaranteed to arrive
//!
//! Use cases can be:
//! * Sending player data does not always have to arrive, because the location is updated 10 times a second (unconfirmed)
//! * Login information should always arrive, but this can take a second (confirmed)
